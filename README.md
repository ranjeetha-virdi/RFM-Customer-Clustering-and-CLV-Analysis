## RFM-Customer-Clustering-and-CLV-Analysis
Analysis of customers in a marketing senario to better understand Recency, Frequency and Monetary analysis
In this task, we use will analyse "sales_data.csv" dataset. The dataset describes sales over time. The dataset contains the following columns:

    Date: Transaction date
    Customer_ID: Customer ID
    Transaction_ID: Transaction ID
    SKU_Category: Category ID of the purchased product
    SKU: ID of the purchased product
    Quantity: Quantity of the purchased product
    Sales_Amount: Transaction value

**Objective**

    Perform an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis using this data. Based on the RFM analysis, segment buyers into 4 segments (A, B, C, and D customers).
    Add Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) as a new feature for each customer.
    In addition, we will perform a CLV prediction for each of the segments identified during the RFM analysis.

    We will visualize the results from this task using Looker Studio. We will transfer this results from above analysis to a Google Sheet and we will connect this sheet to Looker      Studio. Within Looker Studio, we will represent the data in a manner we understand the data better by selecting appropriate visualization forms to make your results insightful     such as the order value over time.
